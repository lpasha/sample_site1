	Everyday life has enough rules. Sitting down for a delicious, comforting meal shouldn't have any. 
	That's why at our restaurants, you're invited to be yourself and enjoy special moments with family and friends. 
	And while we don't have any official rules, we do have a few suggestions that are sure to make you smile.
